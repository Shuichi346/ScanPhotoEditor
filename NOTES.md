# Engineering Notes

## 2026-06-24

- The application uses a package-based `ReferenceFileDocument`.
- Originals are retained as bytes in document state so unsaved imports can be written into a new package.
- Geometry uses normalized top-left-origin coordinates throughout the model and UI.
- Detection uses Vision `DetectRectanglesRequest`; rendering uses only Core Image perspective correction plus explicit user transformations.
- Processing concurrency is bounded to two source images.
